            <p> Elon Musk, (born June 28, 1971, Pretoria, South Africa),<br>
                 South African-born American entrepreneur who cofounded the electronic-payment firm PayPal and<br>
                  formed SpaceX, maker of launch vehicles and spacecraft.
                   He was also one of the first significant investors in,<br>
                    as well as chief executive officer of, the electric car manufacturer Tesla.<br><br>
                    
                    <h3 class="section-heading2">Early life</h3> 
                    <p>Musk was born to a South African father and a Canadian mother.<br>
                        He displayed an early talent for computers and entrepreneurship.<br>
                        At age 12 he created a video game and sold it to a computer<br>
                        magazine. In 1988, after obtaining a Canadian passport, Musk left<br>
                        South Africa because he was unwilling to support apartheid<br>
                        through compulsory military service and because he sought the<br>
                        greater economic opportunities available in the United States.<br></p>

                <h3 class="section-heading2">PayPal and SpaceX</h3>
                <p>Musk attended Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, and in 1992 he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania,<br>
                    Philadelphia, where he received bachelor’s degrees in physics and economics in 1997. He enrolled in graduate school <br>
                    in physics at Stanford University in California, but he left after only two days because he felt that the Internet had  <br>
                    much more potential tochange society than work in physics. In 1995 he founded Zip2, a company that provided maps and   <br>
                    business directories to onlinenewspapers. In 1999 Zip2 was bought by the computer manufacturer Compaq for $307 million, <br>
                    and Musk then founded an online financial services company, X.com, which later became PayPal, which specialized in <br>
                    transferring money online. The online auction eBay bought Patpal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.<br>
                    Musk was long convinced that for life to survive, humanity has to become a multiplanet species. However, he was dissatisfied with <br>
                    the great expense of rocket launchers. In 2002 he founded Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to make more affordable, <br>
                    rockets. Its first two rockets were the Falcon 1 (first launched in 2006) and the larger Falcon 9 (first launched in 2010), which <br>
                    were designed to cost much less than competing rockets. A third rocket, the Falcon Heavy (first launched in 2018), was designed to <br>
                    carry 117,000 pounds (53,000 kg) to orbit, nearly twice as much as its largest competitor, the Boeing Company’s Delta IV Heavy, <br>
                    for one-third the cost. SpaceX has announced the successor to the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy: the Super Heavy–Starship <br>
                    system. The Super Heavy first stage would be capable of lifting 100,000 kg (220,000 pounds) to low Earth orbit. The payload<br>
                    would be the Starship, a spacecraft designed for providing fast transportation between cities on Earth and building bases on the Moon and Mars.<br>

            <p>SpaceX also developed the Dragon spacecraft, which carries supplies to the International Space Station (ISS).<br>
                Dragon can carry as many as seven astronauts, and it had a crewed flight carrying astronauts Doug Hurley and Robert<br>
                Behnken to the ISS in 2020. Musk sought to reduce the expense of spaceflight by developing a fully reusable rocket that could lift<br>
                off and return to the pad it launched from. Beginning in 2012, SpaceX’s Grasshopper rocket made several short flights to test<br>
                such technology. In addition to being CEO of SpaceX, Musk was also chief designer in <br>
                building the Falcon rockets, Dragon, and Grasshopper.<br> <br>

            <h3 class="section-heading2">Tesla</h3>
            <p>
                Musk had long been interested in the possibilities of electric cars, and in 2004 he became one of the major funders of Tesla  <br>
                Motors (later renamed Tesla), an electric car company founded by entrepreneurs Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. <br>
                In 2006 Tesla introduced its first car, the Roadster, which could travel 245 miles (394 km) on a single charge. Unlike most <br>
                previous electric vehicles, which Musk thought were stodgy and uninteresting, it was a sports car that could go from  <br>
                0 to 60 miles (97 km) per hour in less than four seconds. In 2010 the company’s initial public offering raised about <br>
                $226 million. Two years later Tesla introduced the Model S sedan, which was acclaimed by automotive critics for its performance  <br>
                and design. The company won further praise for its Model X luxury SUV, which went on the market in 2015. The Model 3, <br>
                a less-expensive vehicle, went into production in 2017.<br>

                <p>
                    Musk expressed reservations about Tesla being publicly traded, and in August 2018 he made a series of tweets about taking the, <br>
                    company private, noting that he had “secured funding.” The following month the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission<br>
                    (SEC) sued Musk for securities fraud, alleging that the tweets were “false and misleading.” Shortly thereafter Tesla’s board <br> 
                    rejected the SEC’s proposed settlement, reportedly because Musk had threatened to resign. However, the news sent Tesla stock <br>
                    plummeting, and a harsher deal was ultimately accepted. Its terms included Musk stepping down as chairman for three years,<br> 
                    though he was allowed to continue as CEO.<br>
                    Dissatisfied with the projected cost ($68 billion) of a high-speed rail system in California, Musk in 2013 proposed an alternate<br>
                    faster system, the Hyperloop, a pneumatic tube in which a pod carrying 28 passengers would travel the 350 miles (560 km) <br>
                    between Los Angeles and San Francisco in 35 minutes at a top speed of 760 miles (1,220 km) per hour, nearly the speed of <br>
                    sound. Musk claimed that the Hyperloop would cost only $6 billion and that, with the pods departing every two minutes on <br>
                    average, the system could accommodate the six million people who travel that route every year. However, he stated that, <br>
                    between running SpaceX and Tesla, he could not devote time to the Hyperloop’s development. <br>
